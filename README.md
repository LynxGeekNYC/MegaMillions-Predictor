# MegaMillions-Predictor
Toying with a Linear Regression Model Algorithm using Python to Predict MegaMillion Lotto Numbers. So far, it's been accurately predicting 2-3 numbers.

To predict future numbers based on prior results, you could use a machine learning algorithm that takes in the previous numbers as input and outputs the predicted numbers. One approach you could take is to use a supervised learning algorithm, where you provide the model with examples of input-output pairs and train it to predict the output given a new input.

Here's an example of how you could implement this in Python.

This example uses a linear regression model to predict the output based on the input, but you could try using other types of models to see if they perform better.
